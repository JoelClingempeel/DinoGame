# Dino-Visits-The-Museum

**Note:**  This was an old project which was significant to me as it was first substantial coding project, and I recently wanted to share it on Github.

Play as a dinosaur in a platform game where you fight opponents on your journey to the museum.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move, up to jump, down to crouch, and space to shoot projectiles.

The classes in sidescrollerEngine.py makes it easy to create similar platform games with your own images.
